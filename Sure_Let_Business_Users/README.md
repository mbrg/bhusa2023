## Abstract

Business professionals are tired of waiting for IT to address their needs. Instead, they are increasingly building their own applications with low-code / no-code platforms. Recent surveys show that most enterprise apps are now built outside of IT by business professionals who hold no previous experience in building software.

And so, enterprises are placing *developer-level power* in the hands of 100x *new* business developers. What could go wrong?

In short, everything. In this presentation, we will share extensive research on the security of low-code / no-code applications based on scanning >100K applications across hundreds of enterprise environments. We will demonstrate how most applications get identity, access and data flow wrong, cover a wide range of security issues found in real environments, and share their backstories and implications.

We will share the OWASP Low-Code / No-Code Top 10, the first-ever security framework for the categorization and mitigation of common security issues with business-led development. We will illustrate why the involvement of AppSec teams is desperately missing from business-led development, and share stories about organizations that got it right. Finally, we will share resources to help educate others and become a low-code security champion in your organization.
